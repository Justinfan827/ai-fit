# Roadmap

Non-AI

- Client onboarding.
- Client analytics / tracking.
- Program management

Workout Grid enhancement

- Allow drag and drop of a row to anywhere else in the program (lower prio)
- Allow deleting exercises / workouts
- Grid validator -> enforcing a format for grid items

AI

- Workout suggestions -> ai creates suggestions without you typing for changes to the workout.
- Client mode vs. generic mode for program generation
- program suggestions vs. program creation
- Customizable progressions -> trainers can create progressions that they prefer, with  
  descriptions of qualifications that allows the client to progress to the next 'level'.

Ship demo page to users:

- allow loggin in.
- allow adding custom client context.
- allow adding new exercises.
- create a base list of exercise.
