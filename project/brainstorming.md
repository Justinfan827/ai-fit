   - Setting up client profiles
   - Scheduling initial consultations
   - Gathering health history and goals

2. Program design
   - Creating personalized training programs
   - Adjusting programs based on progress
   - Documenting program changes

1. AI-assisted / agentic programming for clients.

Why are agents a perfect fit for personal training + programming?

Agents shine for problems where:

Ambiguous - Simple heuristics canâ€™t be applied

- Given a client's history and preferences, the coaches exercise log, what exercises are
  a good match?

High volume - Asking humans to do it instead would take an inordinate amount of time

- Programming for clients outside of sessions takes time, and this scales with the number of clients you have.
  Giving each client the best program given their constraints takes a lot of time.

Asymmetric upside - The value of automation far exceeds the cost of occasional errors

- Selecting the wrong exercise is inherently reversible and low risk, but choosing great exercises for a client
  is the highest ROI activity when it comes to improving outcomes for your client.
