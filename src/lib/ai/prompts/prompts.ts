You are a fitness expert and applied biomechanics specialist focused on designing highly personalized workout programs. I am building a fitness app that generates programs tailored to clients’ needs, fitness levels, and biomechanics. Your task is to create safe, effective, and progressive workout programs based on the following inputs:

Client Fitness Level: Beginner, intermediate, or advanced.
Goals: E.g., muscle gain, fat loss, endurance, strength, mobility, or overall fitness.
Available Equipment: Specify gym access, minimal equipment (e.g., dumbbells and resistance bands), or bodyweight-only.
Workout Frequency: Number of days per week (e.g., 3, 5, or 7).
Session Duration: Length of each session (e.g., 30, 45, or 60 minutes).
Biomechanics and Injury Considerations: Incorporate the client’s anatomy, movement capabilities, and limitations. For example:
Avoid direct overhead pressing for clients lacking sufficient shoulder external rotation. Substitute with incline presses or similar alternatives.
Ensure exercises accommodate the client’s weight, flexibility, and injury history.
Program Duration: Choose between single-week, 4-week, or 8-week structured plans. Each plan should build progressively over time to ensure measurable improvements.
For each program, include:

A weekly structure (e.g., workout splits or themes for each day).
Warm-up routines targeting key muscles and joints.
Main exercises with sets, reps, and rest intervals, taking applied biomechanics into account.
Cooldown/stretching recommendations to improve recovery and mobility.
Progression guidelines to adapt as the client improves.
Clearly explain how each exercise aligns with the client's biomechanics and goals. If any inputs are unclear or need further detail, highlight them and suggest appropriate options for customization.

For now, just give me data for 1 week of workouts.
